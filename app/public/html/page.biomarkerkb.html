<h4 id="Top">BiomarkerKB Project</h4>

<body>
    <p>BiomarkerKB is a CFDE sponsored project to develop a knowledgebase that will organize and integrate biomarker data from different public sources. The data will be connected to contextual information to show a novel systems-level view of biomarkers.</p>

    <p>The motivation for this project is to improve the harmonization and organization of biomarker data. This will be done by mapping biomarkers from public sources to, and across, CF data elements. This mapping will bridge knowledge across multiple DCCs and biomedical disciplines.</p>

    <p>The scope of this project includes the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Mapping biomarkers from public sources to relevant data elements.</li>
        <li>Developing a framework for organizing biomarker data.</li>
        <li>Creating tools for querying and exploring biomarker data.</li>
        <li>Disseminating the results of this project to the research community.</li>
    </ul>
  
    <br>

    <p>The benefits of this project include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Improved access to biomarker data.</li>
        <li>Increased understanding of the relationships between biomarkers and disease.</li>
        <li>Facilitated drug development and clinical trials</li>
        <li>Improved personalized medicine</li>
    </ul>

    <br>

    <p>This project is expected to have a significant impact on the field of biomarker research. It will make biomarker data more accessible and understandable, and it will facilitate the use of biomarkers in drug development and clinical trials. This will ultimately lead to improved personalized medicine for patients.</p>

    <br>

    <p>The project will use a variety of methods to achieve its goals, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Data mining: The project will use data mining techniques to extract and organize biomarker data from public sources.</li>
        <li>Ontology development: The project will develop a common ontology for biomarkers to facilitate the integration of data from multiple sources.</li>
        <li>Software development: The project will develop software tools to support the management and analysis of biomarker data.</li>
        <li>Training and outreach: The project will provide training and outreach materials to help researchers use the data and tools developed by the project.</li>
    </ul>
