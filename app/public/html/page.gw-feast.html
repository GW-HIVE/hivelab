            The GW Federated Ecosystems for Analytics and Standardized Technologies (GW-FEAST) project is part of the
            ARPA-H FEAST performer team initiative that includes academic and industry partners. The goal of the ARPA-H
            performer teams is to create bridges across data silos to make health data more accessible and usable.

            ARPA-H FEAST offers two major innovations for digital healthcare ecosystems addressing current challenges.

        <ol>
            <li>Agnostic federation across multiple data sources allows DNA HIVE to move computations to data instead of
                moving data to computation; this avoids violation of regulations for data export while using all data.
            </li>
            <li>Agnostic harmonization through self-standardizing protocols enables computers to handshake and find
                appropriate standard transformations as per need without prior need for expensive standardization
                efforts at sites.</li>
